    What does the following expression print to the console?

    ```javascript
    console.log(Boolean(3 > 1));
    ```
  answer: |2

    ```javascript
    true
    ```

    The number 3 is greater than the number 1, so the boolean condition returns true.  Boolean conditions are statements that return true or false.
