    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var fun = ["dance", "party"];
    var bang = function (x) {
      console.log(x + "!");
    }
    fun.forEach(bang);
    ```

    <pre>
    dance!
    party!
    </pre>

    The forEach() function iterates over every element in the fun array and calls the anonymous function that is assigned to the bang variable.  This code yields and equivalent result.

    ```javascript
    bang("dance");
    bang("party");
    ```
