    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var counter = 25;
    while (counter < 28) {
      console.log("The counter is " + counter);
      counter = counter + 1;
    }
    ```

    <pre>
    The counter is 25
    The counter is 26
    The counter is 27
    </pre>

    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var i = 0;
    while (i < 3) {
      i++;
      console.log("I like " + i);
    }
    ```

    <pre>
    I like 1
    I like 2
    I like 3
    </pre>

    The variable i is incremented before the console.log statement so the results are slightly different from what we've seen so far.

    ```javascript
    var sum = 0;
    counter = 0;
    while (counter < 5) {
      sum = sum + counter;
      counter = counter + 1;
    }
    console.log(sum);
    ```

    This loops adds the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and assigned the result (10) to the sum variable.  This example is a bit more complex because two variables are being reassigned for each loop iteration.
